To use these commands you will need to use Red Alien (aka Advance Script Compiler).  
http://www.cosarara.me/redalien/manual/  
  
You need to modify its command list, which is in the file data/commands.txt  
You have to add the contents of "ASC_commands.txt" right before the first pair of curly brackets are closed.
There is a structure similar to this:  
({
	...
	...
	ADD THE COMMANDS HERE
	},

{
	...
	...},

[...]
)
